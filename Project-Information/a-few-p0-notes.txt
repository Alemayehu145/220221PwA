Here are a few notes for your project:

1. for your entities, please make sure they, at minimum, include the following:

customer/user: Id, Name

accounts: id, balance, customer_id

2. You may choose how you wish to implement the functionality/user stories for this project

example: both options below for implementing withdrawing/depositing money are acceptable (just make sure
in your actual project that you inlcude data validation in your service layer)


def service_deposite_withdraw(self, transcation_type:str, value, account_id):
	if transaction_type == "deposite":
		return self.dao.deposite_method(value, account_id)
	elif transaction_type == "withdraw":
		return self.dao.withdraw_method(value, account_id)

def service_deposite(value, account_id):
	return dao.deposite_method(value, account_id)

def service_withdraw(value, account_id):
	return dao.withdraw_method(value, account_id)
