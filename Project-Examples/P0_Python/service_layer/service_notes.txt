Since my DAL is going to handle the basic CRUD operations, since it is my DAL that specifically interacts with
my database, I will use my service layer to handle actually implementing my user stories.

For this example project I will be using the following user stories:

As a user I want to be able to add a team to the database so I can always see its information
As a user I want to be able to see team information so I can be reminded of it
as a user I want to be able to update team information so I can correct it when need be
As a user I want to be able to remove team information so I can adjust the list if a team leaves the league

As a user I want to be able to add players to the database so everyone can see their information
As a user I want to be able to see player information because I think their information is cool
As a user I want to be able to update player information because players change teams and names
As a user I want to be able to remove player information because sometimes they retire
