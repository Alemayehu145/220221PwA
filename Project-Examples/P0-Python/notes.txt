REMINDER: this is just a basic example of how to create a 3-tiered web application. Just copying and pasting this
information into your own project will not work: you must adjust it to meet the requirements of your own
projects.

In this example, I will be creating a basic basketball fan application, where people can add player and team
information into a central database, and also view that information.




api_layer: this will hold code for my api

service_layer: this will hold code for my service logic

dal_layer: this will hold code for interacting with my database

entities: this will hold my custom class code for any entities I need to work with

tests: this will hold all my tests (will be using pytest for TDD)
