# Agile

### Waterfall
Before Agile development there was the waterfall methodology. In the waterfall methodology, everything was predetermined, contracts were written, and developers knew exactly what they needed to do, and when it needed to get done.

1. team is hired to work on a project
2. contract is written for what the team is going to actually do
3. timeline for work is established
4. work happens

The big thing about the waterfall method is that you NEVER go back a step: timeline was miscalculated? Too bad. Company that hired you realizes they are overpaying you by 10X your work value? Too bad, but good for the developers. Developers realize they are being paid 10X less than they are worth? Too bad.

Another problem with the waterfall method when it comes to software development is that a client might realize half way through development that the work they asked you to do is actually irrelevant for what they truly want. 

The waterfall methodology (a process that never goes back to previous steps of implementation) is a very practical methodology when you need to get something right the first time. 

### Agile
The Agile methodology is not about specific frameworks on architecures for programming, but is instead a different development mindset. There are four core tenants of Agile development
- Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
- Working Software over comprehenisve documentation
- Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
