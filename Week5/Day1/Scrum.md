# Scrum as Agile Development
Scrum is an iterative way of doing software development. A Scrum will consist of generally 2-3 weeks of incremental development that focuses on slowly building up a final product. Due to the iterative nature of the develpment process, it makes it very easy to implement the Agile mindset while doing development.

### 4 Roles of a Scrum
- Stakeholder
    - The individual or company a product is being created for
        - Bank of America
        - an entrepenuer
        - AT@T
        - etc.
- Product Owner
    - the representative of the Stakeholder
    - this is the go-to person when you need to give updates, get clarification, report changes, etc. 
- Scrum Leader
    - Individual in charge of the Scrum team
        - tends to be a technically skilled individual (think lead developer)
    - primary point of contact with the product owner
    - a Scrum leader has many roles with the team
        - they encourage the team 
        - assist with debugging 
        - assit in communicating between teammates
        - assist with development
- Scrum teammates (Scrumlings)
    - these are the individuals who are doing the coding, testing, devops, etc
        - you could be a developer
        - you could be devops
        - you could be a business analyst

### Scrum Process
Because the Scrum process is an iterative one, Scrum happens in "sprints", which are usually two to three weeks. In this time, there are a couple "ceremonies" that need to happen.
- User Story Grooming
    - this is the event where the user stories for the sprint are created. This is the first event of the sprint.
    - after user stories are created, then the acceptance criteria should also be written up
        - these are step-by-step instructions for completing the user story
    - after the user stories and acceptance criteria have been written story pointing can happen
        - this is where levels of difficulty are determined for the different user stories that have been written
    - the final activity is to assign user stories to different individuals/teams
- Daily Standup
    - this is a daily ceremony where the individual teams of the Scrum meet to check in with one another and make sure everyone is on the same page
        - discussion about progress can happen
        - discussion about blockers can happen
            - this is a great time to assist teammates who have blockers
        - discussions about requirement changes can happen
        - this is also a good time to check in with each other
- Sprint Retrospective
    - The last activity of the sprint: it is a time to reflect on how the sprint went, and to start preparation for the next sprint
        - what went well?
        - what didn't go well?
        - What didn't get done?
        - What needs to be done next sprint?
        - etc.
