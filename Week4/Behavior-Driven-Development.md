# Behavior Driven Development
So far you have been doing Test Driven Development, which has been limited to your software that you have developed. We are going to take this a step further and start implementing Behavior Driven Development. BDD is a development process where the User's perspective is used as your primary guiding principle. 

### User Stories
User stories are the different actions that a user can take with your application. When writting them there is a general syntax to follow
- Who is doing the action?
    - customer
    - manager
    - banker
    - vistoer
    - ceo
    - etc.
- what is the user trying to do?
    - login
    - logout
    - order food
    - withdraw money
    - transfer money
    - add something to a wish list
    - watch a tv show
    - etc.
- what is the goal?
    - they want to access their bank account
    - they want to eat because they are hungry
    - they want to remember to buy something at a later time
    - they want to relax and enjoy some tv
    - etc.

User stories follow some general rules/guidelines:
- User stories should be as explicit as possible in their meaning
- User stories should list users individually
    - if you have customers and employees that can login, each type of user should get their own login user story

So what are some of the benefits of user stories?
- they provide an outline of what your application actually does
- they provide guardrails for your application to prevent feature creep
- they provide an easy means of creating Acceptance Criteria for your application
